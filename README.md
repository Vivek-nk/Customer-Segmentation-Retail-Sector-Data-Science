# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis 


# R for Recency ; F for Frequency ; M for Monetary


Segmentation is important in retail sector. Customers have different interests and needs, and purchase differently. It is important to identify potential customers from rest. We have to maintain those regular customers and also find out ways to bring irregular customers into the sector of potential customers. 


Customer segmentation is a method of dividing customers in to groups of common characteristics. It is required to identify the potential customers ;  improve quality of service, loyalty and retention; improve customer relationship ; provide special offers to targetted customers etc etc. 


Customer segmentation using RFM analysis means it is a behavior based approach to group customers into segments. It groups customers based on previous purchase transaction. It segments based on how recently a purchase was made, how often purchases are done, and how much did the customer buy. 


Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn are used in this project. Basic concepts of Pandas like handling duplicates, groupby and qcut() for bins based on sample quartiles are also used in this project.
